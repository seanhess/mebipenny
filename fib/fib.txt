Recall that the Fibonacci numbers are defined as follows:

F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1

The first eleven Fibonacci numbers are written out on the second line:

n     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 ...
F(n)  0  1  1  2  3  5  8 13 21 34 55 ...

Given two endpoints A and B, how many unique Fibonacci numbers are there, such
that for a given Fibonnaci number F(n), A <= F(n) <= B?

You will first be given the number of problems to solve, N, and then you will be
given N rows, each consisting of two endpoints A and B. For each row, you must
output the number of unique Fibonacci numbers in that range, inclusive.

Example:

STDIN:

3
2 21
2 4
4 10

STDOUT:

6
2
2
