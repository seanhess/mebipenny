You may remember the classic Windows game of Minesweeper. In this game, an N by
M grid of cells was covered by opaque buttons, and K mines were hidden under
the buttons.

During the initial setup for the game, the Minesweeper program would randomly
place all K mines on the grid and then number the remaining grid cells with how
many adjacent mines each cell had, leaving 0-cells blank. In this way, every
cell is in one of three states:

 1) It has a mine.
 2) It is adjacent, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, to a cell
    with a mine, and keeps count of how many mines it is adjacent to.
 3) It is not adjacent to any mines.

Your job will be to calculate the counts that cells in state (2) have.

You will first be given a line that contains N, M, and K. You will then receive
K additional lines describing where the mines are. Each mine description line
will consist of X and Y, where 0 <= X < N, and 0 <= Y < M.

Your job is to write out all of the counts for cells in state (2) in sorted
order. Your output will be a row for each cell consisting of X, Y, and the
adjacent mine count. You should skip cells in state (3) completely (i.e., cells
with a 0 adjacent mine count). The sort order for your output should be ordered
by X primarily, lowest to highest, with Y lowest to highest breaking ties on X.

Example:

STDIN:

3 3 2
0 0
0 1

STDOUT:

0 2 1
1 0 2
1 1 2
1 2 1
