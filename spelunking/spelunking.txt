A team of spelunkers is spelunking through a series of caves. The caves they
spelunk in are organized in the following way:

Each cave is connected to other caves through at least partially vertical
corridors. Caves can hold all of the available spelunkers, whereas corridors
each have their own limit of the maximum number of spelunkers that can travel
through them at a time. Since the corridors are in some places vertical, the
spelunkers can only travel down. The caves are arranged on a series of levels,
such that every corridor connects a cave from one level to a cave on the very
next level below it. The topmost level has exactly one cave, as does the
bottommost level.

The spelunkers play a simultaneous spelunking game with these caves. All of the
spelunkers start in the topmost cave and all travel to the bottommost cave. The
spelunkers time their descents through the corridors such that every spelunker
moves down exactly one level at the same time.

Since the corridors have a maximum capicity of simultaneous spelunkers, given
a cave description, what is the maximum number of spelunkers the cave system can
support?

The caves are numbered 1..N, where 1 is the topmost cave, and N is the
bottommost cave. There are M corridors.

The first line of STDIN given to you is N. The second line is M.

The next M lines are formatted as A B C, where A is the source cave, B is
the destination cave, and C is the corridor capacity.

Your output should be the maximum number of spelunkers that can participate in
the game of simultaneous spelunking at the same time.

Example:

STDIN:

4
4
1 2 1
1 3 2
2 4 1
3 4 3

STDOUT:

3
