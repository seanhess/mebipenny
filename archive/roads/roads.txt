There are M countries.

In some country, N cities (numbered 1..N) are connected with one-way roads. Each
road has two properties: a length, and the toll required to travel the road. You
want to travel from city 1 to city N, covering the shortest distance possible.
However, you have limited funds. For each country description, find the shortest
path from city 1 to city N that you can afford.

Input:

The first line is M, the number of countries there are. For each country:

 * You are given a line consisting of C, the number of bitcoins you can spend in
   that country, 0 <= C <= 10000
 * You are given a line consisting of N, the number of cities, 2 <= N <= 1000
 * You are given a line consisting of R, the number of roads, 1 <= R <= 10000
 * You are given R lines, each containing 4 numbers S, D, L, and T, describing
   each road. S is the source city, D is the destination city, L is the road
   length, and T is the toll to use the road (in bitcoins).

Output:

For each country, give the total distance traveled, or -1 if no acceptable route
exists.
