Chromakey is a technique to replace all pixels in an image that fall in a
certain color range with the pixels from another image. In other words, a green
screen.

Input:

The first two lines consist of one integer each, the width W and height H of the
images to follow, each between 1 and 256. After that, each line will consist of
three numbers R G and B, each between 0 and 255. There will be W x H lines for
the first (base) image, and then another W x H lines for the second (overlay)
image.

Output:

Output the chromakey'd image. For every pixel in the first image where the Green
value is greater than the combined Red and Blue value, replace that pixel with
the corresponding pixel from the second image. Every other pixel remains
unchanged in the output.

Example:

STDIN:

2
2
75 35 5
15 255 35
12 46 35
16 48 5
0 0 0
15 75 30
5 25 3
0 4 0

STDOUT:

75 35 5
15 75 30
12 46 35
0 4 0
